# UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) Example

Unmodified code from the examples provided on ICON (minus some formatting changes).

To run, should only need to modify line #11: replace the Bluetooth address to the address of the Arduino being used, as determined from the `hciconfig` > `sudo bluetoothctl` > `scan on` series of terminal commands on the Raspberry Pi.
